## Credits

**Mango Studio is a fork of [Lemon Studio](https://github.com/ItsAlphaNeon/Lemon-Studio) by ItsAlphaNeon**, renamed so it
is not confused with the original. Almost all of its code, design and documentation is ItsAlphaNeon's and the Lemon
Studio contributors' work, used under the GNU GPL, version 3 or later; their copyright lines stay in every file they
wrote. Mango Studio does not claim to be Lemon Studio or to be made or endorsed by its author.

What Mango Studio changes from Lemon Studio:

- The name, logo and icons (a mango with an equalizer inside), and the built-in plugins' names (Mango Sampler, Mango Trio, ...).
  Projects and presets saved with the Lemon names still open: the plugins answer to their old names too.
- Its settings folder is `Mango Studio`; Lemon Studio's settings are copied there at the first start.
- An FL-style start layout (channel rack, a full-height playlist, a tall mixer along the bottom), interface scaling that
  follows the monitor's resolution, FL-style round switches and step buttons, and the playlist's playhead line.

## Overview

Mango Studio is a pattern-based music production environment: build patterns in a step sequencer and
piano roll, arrange them on a playlist, and mix them through a routable mixer. It is written from the
ground up in Rust, with a sample-accurate audio engine, a fast CPU-rendered interface and hosting for
CLAP, VST3 and VST2 plugins.

Mango Studio runs on Windows, Linux and macOS, and every change is built and tested on all three. macOS is supported
at the same level as Linux; the few differences are listed in the [macOS notes](#macos).

A central goal is **interoperability**: Mango Studio opens and saves FL Studio projects (`.flp`). The
project reader is built to round-trip: anything in a file that Mango Studio does not understand yet is
kept and written back unchanged, so a project survives being opened and saved. This support is still
young, so read the warning below before trying it on real work.

> [!WARNING]
> **Mango Studio is pre-alpha software.** It is under active development and is not yet a usable DAW:
> expect missing features, rough edges and breaking changes.
>
> - **Greyed-out controls are not implemented yet.** Many menus and buttons are already laid out but do
>   nothing so far; they are drawn dim and say "not available yet".
> - **No prebuilt binaries** will be published until Mango Studio reaches a usable state. Until then it
>   can only be built from source.
> - **Only projects saved by FL Studio 24.2 or later open for now** (25 and 26 included). Older projects
>   are refused with a dialog that explains how to re-save them; support for them is on the roadmap.
> - **Project-file support is at a very early stage.** Do not overwrite your original `.flp` projects
>   with files saved by Mango Studio until this support is declared stable. Work on copies and keep backups.

## Capabilities

Where Mango Studio stands against what a complete DAW offers:

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|:---:|---|
| Step sequencing and patterns | ✅ | Channel rack with steps, mini piano rolls, swing and per-channel loops |
| Piano roll | ✅ | Full tool set, velocity and event lanes, quantize (FL's templates), chop (FL's patterns), randomize (melodies and levels), strum, arpeggiate, flam, claw machine, flip, level scaling, limit, LFO and more |
| Song arrangement | ✅ | Playlist with pattern, audio and automation clips, clip groups, markers and several arrangements |
| Mixing and routing | ✅ | Mixer tracks, sends, effect slots and meters; sidechain inputs for a project's Fruity Limiter slots and for CLAP and VST3 effects |
| Plugin hosting | ✅ | CLAP, VST3 and VST2 instruments and effects with their editors; "Create automation clip" in CLAP and VST3 plugins' own parameter menus; a parameter menu for every plugin parameter (automation clips, controller links, typed and set values); on Windows a crashing plugin is stopped instead of closing Mango Studio; no 32-bit plugins |
| Plugin management | ✅ | Plugin manager with your own search folders, a crash-safe background scan, favourites and hidden plugins; presets of your own and factory presets, import of `.vstpreset`, `.fxp` and `.fxb` files, and preset files dropped onto a plugin |
| Time-stretching | ✅ | All twelve stretch methods for samples and audio clips, played by one open-source stretcher |
| Playback engine | 🚧 | Renders ahead of the audio device so edits do not cause dropouts; voice limits, cut groups, glides, layer channels; one audio thread for now |
| Automation | 🚧 | Clips for channel, mixer and plugin parameters with every curve shape; channel volume and pan moves record into a pattern; not yet recording into automation clips, or clip LFO |
| Project files | 🚧 | Opens and saves projects from FL Studio 24.2 and later; older versions are on the roadmap. Keep backups |
| Built-in instruments and effects | 🚧 | Instruments: Mango Sampler (long samples can play straight from disk), Mango Trio (three oscillators), Citrus (a six-operator synth that plays Sytrus patches), Mango Kick (a kick drum), Mango Boom (a bass drum), Mango Bass (a bass guitar) and Mango Acid (an acid bass). Effects: Mango Parametric EQ (all of FL's quality modes: HQ+, HQ Enhanced, linear phase), Limiter, Reverb, Delay, Chorus, Stereo Shaper, Stereo Enhancer, Balance, Soft Clipper, Fast Distortion, Transient Processor, Press (FL's Maximus) and Pulp Filter (FL's Fruity Love Philter). All built in, and also VST3 and CLAP plugins for other DAWs; a project's Fruity Limiter slots play Mango Limiter's sound, sidechain included |
| Exporting audio | ✅ | Song, pattern or selection to WAV, FLAC, MP3 and OGG at once; bit depth, sample rate, interpolation, dither, mono, tails, stems and WAV markers; a pattern rendered as an audio clip (Quick render, Render and replace) |
| MIDI file import / export | ✅ | Import into a new project, the open one or a piano roll channel (tracks, channels, tempo changes, time signatures, markers); export a pattern or the song's patterns |
| Note input | 🚧 | Mouse, computer keyboard, MIDI controllers (velocity curves, sustain pedal, pitch bend, aftertouch) and the touch controller; note recording into patterns with loop record, precount and Start on input; step edit |
| MIDI controllers and sync | ✅ | Link any knob, fader or plugin parameter to a controller (or many at once with Multilink); MIDI clock and time code out, external clock in |
| Undo | 🚧 | One history for the whole project, with redo and the browser's History: edits, knobs and faders, channels added and deleted, project settings; not yet for a plugin editor's own changes |
| Audio drivers | 🚧 | WASAPI (shared and exclusive) and ASIO® (output, and inputs for audio recording) on Windows, ALSA (and PipeWire / PulseAudio through it) on Linux, Core Audio on macOS; no JACK yet |
| Platforms | 🚧 | Windows 10 / 11, Linux (X11, and Wayland through XWayland) and macOS 11 or newer; macOS is supported at the same level as Linux |
| Look and themes | 🚧 | Lemon and Citrus (formerly Classic) skins; 25 built-in themes, your own themes and `.flstheme` files colour either skin, with live adjustments and a colour picker; Lemon plugin editors in the Lemon design only |
| Settings | 🚧 | The General, Audio, MIDI, File, Theme, Project, Info and Recording pages work; a few controls stay greyed out until their features are built |
| Audio recording | 🚧 | One-click audio recording into the playlist or the audio editor, from ASIO or system inputs; Tesla records what reaches its mixer slot |
| Audio editing | ✅ | Tesla, the audio editor and recorder after FL's Edison: a mixer effect (and VST3 / CLAP plugin) with markers, regions, destructive edits and tools; a project's Edison slots open in it |
| Plugin delay compensation | 🚧 | Plugins' reported delays and the mixer tracks' latency settings, in playback and exports; the settings can't be edited yet |

✅ usable · 🚧 partial · ❌ not available yet

Per-area details are in [docs/status.md](docs/status.md). The full, item-by-item roadmap is in the
[Roadmap](#roadmap) section below, and kept on the original Lemon Studio's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/yC2uCuGs3M).

## Getting started

No prebuilt binaries are provided at this stage: Mango Studio is built from source. Each platform below goes from a fresh
machine to Mango Studio installed with its icon, and Mango Studio's own plugins installed for any DAW. All three need
**Rust**, stable toolchain 1.89 or newer, installed through [rustup](https://rustup.rs/), and a clone of this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apikun/Lemon-Studio-but-bad.git
cd Lemon-Studio-but-bad
```

`cargo run -p os-app --release` builds and runs Mango Studio. Before Mango Studio starts, it also rebuilds Mango
Studio's own plugins (Mango Sampler, Mango Trio, Mango Parametric EQ, Mango Limiter, Mango Reverb, Mango Delay, Mango
Soft Clipper, Mango Fast Distortion, Mango Balance, Mango Stereo Enhancer, Mango Transient Processor, Mango Chorus,
Mango Stereo Shaper, Citrus, Tesla, Press, Pulp Filter, Mango Kick, Mango Boom, Mango Bass and Mango Acid) and
installs the ones that changed as VST3 and CLAP plugins, in the folders where other DAWs find them. Mango Studio itself
has every one of them built in and needs no plugin files. A plugin that is new or updated in the repository shows up
in other DAWs at the next run. The first run builds every plugin, which takes
a few minutes more; later runs rebuild only what changed. Set `OPENSTUDIO_NO_PLUGIN_BUILD=1` to skip the plugin build. A
Mango Studio installed as below builds nothing: after pulling changes, either run the command above once, or build and
install only the plugins with `cargo run -p bundle-plugins -- --install`.

### Windows

Windows 10 or 11, x64. A ready-to-run build is attached to this repository's GitHub releases: a portable
`lemonstudio.exe`, with no installer and no runtime to install.

**Prerequisites**

- The Microsoft C++ build tools that Rust uses (rustup offers them when it installs; otherwise the Visual Studio Build
  Tools with the "Desktop development with C++" workload). They include the Windows SDK, which embeds the application
  icon in the program; without the SDK the build still succeeds, without the icon.
- LLVM, whose libclang generates the time stretcher's and the ASIO SDK's bindings at build time:
  `winget install LLVM.LLVM`. If `libclang.dll` is not in LLVM's default folder, set `LIBCLANG_PATH` to the folder
  that holds it.

**Build and run**

```powershell
cargo run -p os-app --release
```

**Install** `lemonstudio.exe`, with its icon, into `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin`, and give it a Start menu entry (from there
it can be pinned to the taskbar):

```powershell
cargo install --path crates/os-app
$link = (New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell).CreateShortcut("$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Mango Studio.lnk")
$link.TargetPath = "$env:USERPROFILE\.cargo\bin\lemonstudio.exe"
$link.Save()
```

**Plugins:** `cargo run -p os-app --release` installs Mango Studio's plugins in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Common\VST3`
and `...\CLAP`, where DAWs find them. To build and install them without starting Mango Studio, run
`cargo run -p bundle-plugins -- --install`.

**Notes**

- A plugin that crashes is stopped (its slot passes the sound through) instead of closing Mango Studio.
- Settings, themes and presets live in `%APPDATA%\Mango Studio`. `OPENSTUDIO_USER_DIR` overrides the folder.
- Plugins are found in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Common\{VST3,CLAP}`, `%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\{VST3,CLAP}` and
  `CLAP_PATH`, plus any folder added in Settings > Plugins. VST2 plugins are found in the folder their installers
  record (`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\VST`, `VSTPluginsPath`) and in those of `%PROGRAMFILES%\VSTPlugins`,
  `%PROGRAMFILES%\Steinberg\VSTPlugins`, `%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\VST2` and `%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%\Steinberg\VST2` that
  exist. 32-bit VST2 plugins cannot be loaded: they are listed as not supported, without being tried.

#### Winlator (Android)

The release build runs on Winlator, which runs Windows programs on Android through Wine and Box64. The interface is
drawn by the CPU (no GPU is used), so it runs in any container on any GPU driver, and the CPU panel's FPS reading
shows how fast it paints.

**Setup**

- Container: Wine 9.x or newer, the Box64 preset "Performance" (if the program will not start, try "Compatibility"),
  four CPU cores or more.
- Audio: the container's PulseAudio driver is the sound card. In Settings > Audio leave shared mode on; if playback
  pops, set Buffer length to 1024.
- Exclusive (WASAPI) mode, ASIO drivers and IAudioClient3's short buffers are not implemented by Wine: the program
  falls back to shared mode on its own and says so above the status lines.
- Small screens: the top band scales down to fit (auto fit, 2026-10-27), so every panel — the output monitor's
  waveform display among them — stays visible on a phone's narrow window. A Toolbars scaling percentage chosen by
  hand is kept as it is.

**If it will not start**, or a plugin crashes it, `%APPDATA%\Mango Studio\panic-log.txt` (in the container:
`C:\users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Mango Studio\panic-log.txt`) holds the last panic's message, and a failure at
startup shows a message box instead of closing quietly.

**If the keyboard and playback make no sound** while the metronome and the Tempo tapper do: a new project's channel
is a sampler with no sample, and a sampler without a sample is silent — the hint bar says so when a note plays on it.
Drop a sample from the browser onto the channel, or add an instrument with the channel rack's plus (Mango Trio,
Mango Kick, Mango Bass, Mango Acid ... all built in). If the hint bar says a plugin did not follow the audio rate,
or nothing helps, set `OS_DEBUG=1` in the container's environment and run once more: the log names the plugin and
the rates it was asked for.

### Linux

x64, on X11 or a Wayland desktop.

**Prerequisites:** a C++ compiler and libclang (for the time stretcher), the ALSA development files, the Wayland
development files (which Mango Sampler's file dialogs link against when it is built as a plugin) and `pkg-config`:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install g++ libclang-dev libasound2-dev libwayland-dev pkg-config
# Arch
sudo pacman -S gcc clang alsa-lib wayland pkgconf
# Fedora
sudo dnf install gcc-c++ clang-devel alsa-lib-devel wayland-devel pkgconf-pkg-config
```

For the "save changes?" prompt, `zenity` or KDE's `kdialog` (a stock KDE desktop has the latter).

**Build and run**

```bash
cargo run -p os-app --release
```

**Install** `lemonstudio` into `~/.cargo/bin` (which must be on your `PATH`), with its icon and an entry in the
application menu (the desktop entry also names the icon under native Wayland):

```bash
cargo install --path crates/os-app
install -Dm644 crates/os-app/assets/lemonstudio.png ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/lemonstudio.png
install -Dm644 crates/os-app/assets/lemonstudio.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/lemonstudio.desktop
```

**Plugins:** `cargo run -p os-app --release` installs Mango Studio's plugins in `~/.vst3` and `~/.clap`. To build and
install them without starting Mango Studio, run `cargo run -p bundle-plugins -- --install`.

**Notes**

Mango Studio runs on X11, and on Wayland desktops through XWayland. Plugin editors on Linux are X11 windows, and an X11
window cannot sit inside a native Wayland one; with the main window on X11 too, plugin windows dock inside it as on
Windows (or detach, from their window menu). A few things differ from Windows for now:

- **Native Wayland** is used only when there is no X server, or when `OPENSTUDIO_WAYLAND=1` is set. Plugin windows are
  then always separate windows, kept above Mango Studio while it is the active application; their window menu, Presets
  list and Misc lists do not open, and files cannot be dropped in from a file manager (the windowing library does not
  support it there).
- **Scaling:** under XWayland Mango Studio follows the X11 scale (`Xft.dpi`). If it looks soft on a fractionally scaled
  Wayland desktop, let X11 applications scale themselves (KDE: Display Configuration > Legacy applications (X11) >
  Apply scaling themselves).
- **Keys** pressed while a plugin's editor has the keyboard focus do not play the typing keyboard yet, and a sample
  dragged from Mango Studio's browser onto a plugin window does not reach the plugin yet.
- **Mango Sampler** cannot copy or paste audio through the clipboard yet.
- **Settings, themes and presets** live in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Mango Studio` (usually `~/.config/Mango Studio`).
  `OPENSTUDIO_USER_DIR` overrides the folder.
- Plugins are found in `~/.clap`, `/usr/lib/clap`, `/usr/local/lib/clap` and `CLAP_PATH`, in `~/.vst3`,
  `/usr/lib/vst3` and `/usr/local/lib/vst3`, and in `VST_PATH` (else `~/.vst`, `/usr/lib/vst`, `/usr/local/lib/vst` and
  the `lxvst` folders that exist) for VST2, plus any folder added in Settings > Plugins.

### macOS

macOS 11 or newer. macOS is supported at the same level as Linux, with the same features, and
continuous integration builds and tests every change on macOS alongside Windows and Linux.

**Prerequisites:** the Xcode Command Line Tools, which bring the compiler and libclang: `xcode-select --install`. Xcode
itself is not needed (only to regenerate the app icon, see `tools/logo/macos-icon.sh`).

**Build and run**

```bash
cargo run -p os-app --release
```

**Install** Mango Studio as an app, `Mango Studio.app` in `~/Applications`, with its icon: it opens from Launchpad,
Spotlight or the Dock (on macOS 26 and later its icon follows the light, dark, tinted and clear icon styles), and the
Finder opens `.flp` projects with it. Without `--install` the app is only written to `target/bundled/`.

```bash
cargo run -p bundle-app -- --install
```

**Plugins:** `cargo run -p os-app --release` installs Mango Studio's plugins as bundles, signed ad hoc so that Apple
silicon loads them, in `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3` and `.../CLAP`. To build and install them without starting Mango
Studio, run `cargo run -p bundle-plugins -- --install`.

**Notes**

Plugin windows dock inside the main window as on Windows, or detach (from their window menu) into windows of their own
that stay above Mango Studio while it is the active application. A few things differ from Windows and Linux:

- **Menu bar:** the window's menus (FILE … HELP) are also in the macOS menu bar, with the same entries.
- **Keys:** Command stands in for Ctrl in every shortcut (Command+S saves), and
  Control+click is a right click. Quit (Command+Q, the menu bar, the Dock) asks about unsaved changes like closing the
  window does.
- **Plugin windows:** a minimized detached window is hidden rather than sent to the Dock; its channel's button brings
  it back. A sample dragged from Mango Studio's browser onto a plugin window reaches Mango Sampler only (other plugins
  take dropped files only from the Finder).
- **FL Studio's factory content** (samples that projects name through `%FLStudioFactoryData%`) is found in the newest
  `/Applications/FL Studio *.app`; `OPENSTUDIO_FACTORY` overrides it.
- **Settings, themes and presets** live in `~/Library/Application Support/Mango Studio`. `OPENSTUDIO_USER_DIR`
  overrides the folder.
- Plugins are found in `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/{CLAP,VST3,VST}`, `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/{CLAP,VST3,VST}` and
  `CLAP_PATH`, plus any folder added in Settings > Plugins. Audio Units are not supported. On Apple silicon, plugins
  built for Intel Macs only (common among older VST2 plugins) cannot be loaded; VST2 ones are listed as not supported,
  without being tried.

### Using Mango Studio

Open a project directly by passing its path:

```bash
cargo run -p os-app --release -- path/to/project.flp
```

Use `FILE > Export audio` (Ctrl+R) to render the song, or the current pattern in PAT mode, to WAV, FLAC, MP3 or OGG files. The same
render runs without a window, hosting the same plugins the app would and without opening an audio device:

```bash
cargo run -p os-app --release -- --render path/to/project.flp out.wav [--rate 48000] [--seconds 30] [--from TICK] [--builtin-only]
```

`--builtin-only` hosts only Mango Studio's own plugins, for a render that is the same on every machine.
Settings > Theme picks the skin (Lemon, or Citrus, the look formerly called Classic) and the theme; the choice is
remembered.

Mango Trio and Mango Parametric EQ were called Mango 3x Osc and Mango Parametric EQ 2 before, and earlier all three
plugins were called Open Sampler, Open 3x Osc and Open Parametric EQ 2. They keep their plugin IDs, so sessions saved
with the old names still open with the new plugins. Installing the plugins (by the run from source or
`bundle-plugins --install`) removes bundles installed under the old names; delete any others you copied yourself, or
DAWs will list each plugin twice.

### Tests

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

Tests that need an audio device are marked `#[ignore]` and run with `cargo test -p os-app -- --ignored`.
Project-file corpus tests run when `OPENSTUDIO_FLP_CORPUS` points to a text file listing `.flp` paths;
project files are never committed to this repository.
The watermark test (`cargo test -p watermark`) checks that every source file opens with its header: a copyright line
for each of its copyright holders, its SPDX licence identifier and the project's name.

### Command-line tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `flp-dump` | Print a project file's event stream and verify that it round-trips |
| `os-render` | Render a project or pattern offline to a WAV file with the engine alone (no hosted plugins, so it does not sound like the app; `--render` above does) |
| `os-play` | Play a project through the default audio output |
| `bundle-plugins` | Build Mango Studio's own plugins as VST3 and CLAP bundles, and optionally install them (`cargo run -p os-app --release` runs it with `--install`) |
| `bundle-app` | Build Mango Studio as a macOS app, and optionally install it |

- ✅ Sample-accurate pattern and song playback
- ✅ Sampler with high-quality windowed-sinc resampling
- ✅ Mixer graph: sends, sidechain routing, measured pan and volume laws
- ✅ Sidechain inputs for mixer slot effects and hosted CLAP / VST3 effects
- ✅ Channel envelopes, note repeat and per-pattern control lanes
- ✅ Automation clips for channel, mixer and plugin parameters
- ✅ Channel note rules: max polyphony, mono, portamento glides, cut groups
- ✅ Glides on every instrument: Mango Trio and Citrus follow portamento and slides, other plugins get pitch bend
- ✅ Live edits reach playback instantly, without clicks
- ✅ Offline rendering (`os-render`) and low-latency WASAPI output
- ✅ Render a project without opening a window (`lemonstudio --render`)
- ✅ Built-in limiter
- ✅ Main swing in playback (measured timing)

- ✅ Mixer tracks: stereo separation, three-band track equaliser, gliding gains
- ✅ Mixer track polarity, stereo swap and effect bypass played
- ✅ Main volume and main pitch knobs work; channel pitch follows root note, fine tune and main pitch

- ✅ Tempo automation playback
- ✅ Playback started inside an audio clip plays it from there, with a short fade-in
- ✅ Export the song or pattern as WAV, FLAC, MP3 or OGG from the Export form, with every hosted plugin
- ✅ Playback under load: rendered ahead of the audio device, so heavy passages and edits no longer drop out (about 4x less audio load)
- ✅ No more stutter from plugins the interface is busy with
- ✅ Audio settings: output device, sample rate and buffer length, applied while playing
- ✅ Stop ends every voice, plugins included
- ✅ Playback accuracy: audio clips at full level, automation on the exact tick with all 13 curve shapes, MP3 timing, slide notes
- ✅ Automation clips drive every target they are linked to; mixer automation of slots, EQ bands, sends and stereo separation
- ✅ Layer channels, channel level adjustments, and each note's own pan and mod X / Y
- ✅ Plugin delay compensation, live and in exports, with the mixer tracks' latency settings
- ✅ Parametric EQ quality modes: HQ+, HQ Enhanced and linear phase, with their delay reported
- 🚧 Engine rework from the engine specifications: sampler voice, automation
- ✅ Fruity Limiter slots in FL projects play the whole limiter: compressor, gate and sidechain
- ✅ ASIO audio output, plus WASAPI exclusive mode on Windows

## Development approach

Mango Studio is developed independently. File-format and behaviour details needed for
interoperability are first written down as specifications, and the product code is implemented
from those specifications and public documentation. All artwork, icons and interface graphics
in this repository are original or come from the openly licensed projects listed below.
## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome from developers who are comfortable with Rust and the pull-request workflow. These rules
come from Lemon Studio and stay:

All contributions must be **clean-room** work. Decompiled code, and code or pseudocode derived from
decompiled output, will not be accepted in any form: the codebase must contain none of it.

Contributors keep the copyright of their work and license it under the GPL, version 3 or later, like the rest of
Mango Studio. In each file you write or substantially change, add a line with your name or username to the copyright
lines at the top of the header, `Copyright (C) <year> <name>`, and keep the lines already there.

## Community

The original project, Lemon Studio, has a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/yC2uCuGs3M). It is Lemon Studio's, not
Mango Studio's: please don't ask there for help with Mango Studio.

Their copyright notices and licence texts are collected in [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt), which
goes with every copy of Mango Studio next to [LICENSE](LICENSE). Its last section, the Rust crates with their licence
texts, is generated by `cargo run -p notices` (with [cargo-about](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about):
`cargo install cargo-about --locked --features cli`); `cargo test` fails while a crate that goes into a build is missing
from it, so run it after changing a dependency.
