//! The rolling sampler (issue #82): a background ring of the master's newest output, a strip of it between the
//! toolbar and the playlist, a selection on the strip that drops onto the playlist as a rendered audio clip.
//!
//! The audio side ([`Rolling`]) lives in the transport's `Shared`, pushed from the renderers' post-master copy (the
//! same place the monitor's tap is fed, `transport.rs`): no mixer insert, previews excluded. It is a rolling tape of
//! the last `cap` frames (30 s to 10 min, Audio ▸ Rolling sampler), RAM only, session lifespan: it never enters a
//! project file, and a project change clears it.
//!
//! The strip's view state ([`Strip`]) lives in the app state: a zoom, a pan back from the live edge and a selection
//! in absolute frames, so a selection stays put on the tape while the newest audio keeps coming.
